## Explanation about the Unity template
This unity project aimed to provide a template for students to use as a guide for their projects.

It contains these parts:

An example scene named "VirtualMuseum":

This scene is created by:

- A 3D model of a building (made by ProBuilder plugin) placed in the ModelsAssessories folder
- 3D models of the products placed in the ModelsAssessories folder
- Images for the walls placed in the Material folder
- Images to create an image viewer placed in the Material folder
- A video for the video player placed in the Video folder
- Some pannels of the information on the walls 
- C sharp scripts to make the user be able to move in the environment, rotating objects, and change the images for the image viewer placed in the Scripts folder.

## Create a simple building with probuilder Unity
First method, using the "New Poly Shape tool":

Note: with this method the interior part of the building will be used. It is a very fast method for every plan of the buildings.
